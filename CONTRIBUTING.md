# Contributing to asghar Scanner

Thank you for taking the time to improve asghar Scanner. This project exists so that people on slow or restricted networks can find Cloudflare IPs that **actually work with their own config** — without reading docs, memorizing flags, or babysitting a terminal.

Every contribution should move us closer to that goal.

## What we optimize for

These priorities are ordered on purpose. When they conflict, resolve them from top to bottom.

| Priority | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Simplicity for users** | Fewer menu items, fewer decisions, sensible defaults. If a feature needs a paragraph of explanation, simplify the feature first. |
| **Low complexity** | Prefer one clear code path over pluggable frameworks. Avoid new abstractions until the same logic appears at least twice. |
| **Clean code** | Small functions, honest names, minimal scope. Match the style of the file you are editing. |
| **Performance** | Scans must stay fast on weak hardware and bad networks. Do not block the UI thread; measure before adding work per IP. |

asghar Scanner is **not** a general-purpose network lab. Resist scope creep: CLI flags, export formats, and power-user toggles only belong here when they serve the main workflow.

## What we welcome

- Bug fixes with a clear root cause
- UX improvements that reduce steps or confusion in the TUI
- Probe / validation accuracy on real restricted networks (Iran, corporate filters, high loss)
- Performance wins that do not sacrifice readability
- Tests that lock in non-obvious behaviour (health rules, sorting, config parsing, multi-port logic)
- Documentation that helps ordinary users, not just developers

## What we usually decline

- New top-level menu flows without a strong user story
- Large refactors unrelated to the change at hand
- Dependencies that pull in heavy toolchains for small gains
- Features that require users to understand xray internals
- “Just in case” configuration surface area

When in doubt, open an issue and describe the problem you are solving before writing a large patch.

---

## Before you code

1. **Search existing issues and PRs** — someone may already be working on it.
2. **For non-trivial work**, open an issue first: what problem, who it helps, proposed approach.
3. **For small fixes** (typo, obvious bug, one-file change), a PR alone is fine — reference the behaviour you fixed.

---

## Development setup

**Requirements:** Go version from [`go.mod`](go.mod), Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/protonmailis16/asgharscanner.git
cd asgharscanner
go mod download
make build          # → ./asgharscanner
make test           # race + coverage
make test-short     # faster, matches CI -short
make vet
make lint           # optional locally; CI runs golangci-lint
```

Run the TUI locally:

```bash
./asgharscanner
# or
make run
```

**Windows:** `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1` builds all platform binaries into `dist/`.

## Project layout

```
cmd/asgharscanner/     entrypoint
internal/
  ui/                  Bubble Tea TUI, pages, commands
  prober/              TCP / TLS / HTTP probes
  engine/              concurrent scan orchestration
  ipsrc/               Cloudflare IP range generation
  result/              metrics, health rules, sorting
  xraytest/            VLESS/Trojan parse, xray config build, validation
  config/              scan defaults
  output/              CSV / JSON / TXT writers (legacy paths)
pkg/version/           ldflags-injected build metadata
```

**Rule of thumb:** UI talks to the engine and xraytest through thin command helpers (`internal/ui/cmds.go`). Keep probe logic out of view functions; keep lipgloss out of probers.

## Design guidelines

### User experience

- **Defaults should work** on a restricted connection without tuning.
- **Progress and errors** must be plain language (“ips.txt not found — place it next to the binary or run folder”), not stack traces in the TUI.
- **Keyboard hints** on every setup screen; arrow keys and vim keys where documented in the README.
- **Do not add CLI flags** for scan behaviour unless there is an exceptional maintenance reason.

### Code

- **Minimize diff size** — the best PR is the smallest one that fully fixes the issue.
- **No drive-by refactors** in the same commit as a feature fix.
- **Comments** explain *why* (DPI behaviour, xray quirks, timeout budgeting), not *what* the next line does.
- **Errors** wrap with context (`fmt.Errorf("open %s: %w", path, err)`) in library code; user-facing strings stay short.
- **Concurrency:** respect existing `context` cancellation; never leak goroutines after the user presses Esc.

### Performance

- Phase 1 may probe **IP × port** combinations — avoid extra allocations or redundant TLS handshakes inside hot loops.
- Background work runs in goroutines started from `tea.Cmd` factories; send results back via typed messages.
- Prefer bounded channels and worker pools over unbounded fan-out.

### Tests

- Add tests when behaviour is easy to regress: health criteria, sorting, URL parsing, port selection, file loading.
- Skip tests that only assert mocks or trivial getters.
- Run `go test ./...` before opening a PR; CI also runs `-race` on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Pull request checklist

- [ ] `go test ./...` passes locally
- [ ] `go vet ./...` passes
- [ ] Change matches an existing issue or includes a one-paragraph description of the user-visible effect
- [ ] README updated if behaviour, menu flow, or defaults changed
- [ ] No unrelated formatting or file churn
- [ ] Screenshots or terminal captures appreciated for TUI changes

### PR title

Use imperative mood, concise scope:

```
fix(ui): show n/a when Phase 2 speed is unavailable
feat(prober): require WS ok for ws-type configs in Phase 1
docs: update Find Working IPs setup table
```

### Commit messages

Same style as PR titles. Body optional; include **why** when the reason is not obvious.

---

## Reporting bugs

Include as much of the following as you can:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| OS / arch | Windows 11 amd64 |
| Version | output of `asgharscanner --version` |
| Screen | Find Working IPs → Phase 2 results |
| Config type | VLESS + WS + TLS (no secrets — redact UUID/password) |
| Expected vs actual | “SPEED shows 0.0 Mbps but endpoint works in v2rayN” |
| Steps | numbered, minimal |

Never paste full share URLs with live credentials in public issues.

## Security

This tool runs network probes and embeds xray for validation. Report sensitive issues privately to the maintainers if you believe you have found a security problem — do not open a public issue with exploit details until coordinated.

## Questions

Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/protonmailis16/asgharscanner/discussions) or issue if you are unsure whether an idea fits. A quick “is this in scope?” question saves everyone time.

Thank you for helping keep asghar Scanner fast, simple, and reliable for the people who actually need it.
